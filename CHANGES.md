for a full listing of issues for each release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2018.11.0 (2018-11-28)

Rose release 56. This release is expected to be used with:
* [cylc-7.8.0](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/releases/tag/7.8.0), and
* [fcm-2017.10.0](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/releases/tag/2017.10.0).

### Noteworthy Changes

[#2256](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/2256):
rose_arch: now fails gracefully if run under `rose app-run` as opposed to run
under `rose task-run`.

[#2254](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/2254):
rosie go: fix authentication caching issue on Gnome Shell desktops.

[#2239](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/2239):
Rose-Cylc realignment part 1:
* The `--host=HOST` option for most Rose-wrapped-Cylc commands should now be
  redundant.
* Rose will now use the suite contact file to determine whether a suite is
  running or not.
* rose suite-gcontrol --all: will now launch `cylc gscan` (instead of launching
  many `cylc gui` which can cause a machine to run out of resource if the user
  is running a large number of suites).
* rose suite-scan: will now invoke `cylc scan` directly.
* On launching a suite, `rose suite-run` will now write (Rose) automatic and
  custom environment variables to head of `suite.rc`.
* New `ROSE_SITE` environment/jinja2 suite variable + `site=SITE` setting -
  useful for site portable suites.

rose_ana: fix grepper path functions.

[#2234](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/2234):

compliments [cylc/cylc#2734](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2734).

[#2207](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/2207):
Rose Configuration Metadata: improve handling of environment variable
substitution in quoted string types.

### Other Changes

Rose Bush is being rebranded *Cylc Review* under the Cylc project. We have not
yet removed Rose Bush logic from the Rose project, but it will no longer be
maintained. We encourage sites and users to migrate to *Cylc Review* soon.

Lots of improvements and fixes to documentation.

Launch programs with `python` instead of `python`.

  will fall-back to the deprecated behaviour; to be retired in a future release).

[#2006](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/2006):

rose metadata: fix referring to top-level-option ids in the fail-if and warn-if
rules.

[#1939](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1939):
Rosie discovery service clients: on authentication failure, the clients will
now keep retrying as long as the user enters entering different credentials
from the previous attempt.

[#1933](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1933):
rose suite-run: `log-*.tar.gz`: is now created by a single `tar` command. For
reference, the original inefficient logic was required because we had to
support running Rose on old Unix systems that do not have access to a modern
`tar` command that has the `-z` option. The old logic used Python's `tarfile`
module to TAR up the log directory and then used the `gzip` command to compress
the resulting TAR file (to avoid inefficient when using Python's built-in
`gzip` logic with the `tarfile` module).  It is now highly unlikely that we had
to support running Rose systems that do not have access to a modern `tar`
command.

[#1932](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1932):
Rose Bush: use `os.stat` to get `last_activity_time` in all Rose Bush pages,
instead of performing an expensive query.

[#1931](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1931):
Rose Bush: remove a remaining Bootstrap 2 class from template.

[#1929](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1929):
rose config-edit: fix an error in the `PageArrayTable` widget, which fails when
it attempts to display an array variable (i.e. a variable with the length
metadata set).

[#1928](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1928):
rose config-edit: fix trigger latent section traceback.

[#1915](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1915):
rose macro: removed un-necessary prompting with optional configuration.
* Allow macros to have a keyword argument `optional_config_name` which will be
  set to the name of the optional configuration used, if any.
* Now only prompts once for unknown values when using optional configurations.

### Highlighted Changes

[#1905](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1905):
rose macro, app-upgrade: fix section comment removal of options bug. This
meant that on upgrade or macro change, some optional configurations could
lose options from their sections. This happened only if the sections were
also present in the main configuration and if they had a differing comment
or ignored state in the optional configuration. Please check if you think
this may have happened to you.

[#1891](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1891):
rose documentation: restyled with Bootstrap 3.
User guide is now available in a single page as well as in multiple pages.

### Noteworthy Changes

[#1913](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1913):
rose configuration: allows a greater range of characters in the indices for
duplicate settings. This is prompted by the move towards including profile
names in the indices for UM STASH namelists - many of these have characters
like `+`, etc.

[#1911](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1911):
rose config-edit: cylc gui launcher: gracefully handle suites that are not
running.

[#1909](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1909):

[fcm-2016.05.0](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/releases/tag/2016.05.0).

### Highlighted Changes

[#1884](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1884):
rose macro: can now be used on a whole suite. Previously, it only worked at
the level of an application configuration.

[#1887](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1887):
rose bush: view: will now serve a file in a tar-gzip archive automatically in
raw mode if it contains Unicode characters. Previously, it would incorrectly
serve the whole tar archive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2016.05.0 (2016-05-05)

Rose release 39. This release works best with
[cylc-6.10.0](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/releases/tag/6.10.0) and
[fcm-2016.05.0](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/releases/tag/2016.05.0).

### User Interface Changes

[#1867](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1867):
rose app-run: fix file installation clash. Suppose we have both
`file/whatever.txt` and `[file:whatever.txt]source=somewhere/whatever.txt`,
the setting in the `rose-app.conf` should take precedence. A bug in the logic
meant that this was not the case. This has now been fixed.

### Highlighted Changes

## 2016.03.0 (2016-03-11)

Rose release 38. This release works best with
[cylc-6.9.1](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/releases/tag/6.9.1) and
[fcm-2016.02.0](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/releases/tag/2016.02.0).

### Highlighted Changes

[#1824](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1824):
rose suite- wrappers: make use of host information in cylc port files to detect
whether suites are running or not. Delete a cylc port file and/or a rose suite
host file if the system is able to detect that no process associated with the
suite is running on the recorded host. This allows suite-run, suite-clean, etc
to proceed if a suite is terminated with a left-over port file.

### Noteworthy Changes

[#1847](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1847):
rose config-edit: fix other namespace state display on trigger. It could get a
target namespace (page/panel) ignored state incorrect following triggering from
another page. This fixes the issue.

[#1845](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1845):
rose task-env: fix alternate calendar mode issue. It was not using the
setting in `CYLC_CALENDAR_MODE`. This fixes the issue.

[#1841](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1841):
rose bush: suites list and cycles list: fix fuzzy time logic. Restored display
of time using fuzzy time for suites list and cycles list, broken by
[#1791](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1791). A toogle delta time button
will now be displayed in suites list and cycles list for users to toggle
between fuzzy time and ISO8601 date-time stamp.

[#1836](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1836):
rose_arch: status string for targets with bad statuses will now be printed to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2016.02.1 (2016-02-25)

[cylc-6.8.1](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/releases/tag/6.8.1) and
[fcm-2016.02.0](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/releases/tag/2016.02.0).

### Highlighted Changes

[#1814](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1814):
rose macro: fix nested triggers for duplicate section options. The logic for
triggering options in duplicate namelists was not right under certain
circumstances. Some namelist:domain options in UM apps had incorrect
trigger-ignored statuses. Some apps will have new, correct error statuses for
these options when this version of Rose is used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2016.02.0 (2016-02-11)

Rose release 36. This release works best with
[cylc-6.8.1](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/releases/tag/6.8.1) and
[fcm-2016.02.0](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/releases/tag/2016.02.0).

### Noteworthy Changes

[#1825](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1825):
rose_arch: fix incorrect behaviour on retry. If the previous attempt to archive
was killed, a subsequent retry would do nothing, due to the premature insertion

rosie copy: on suite copy between 2 repositories, ensure that the destination
prefix is used to determine the value of owner, etc.

[#1809](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1809):
Rose Bush: view: text mode is now the default, which means HTML tags will be
escaped by default. Previously, it would render HTML tags in text files by
default. You can continue to render HTML tags by using the tags mode.

[#1807](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1807):
rosa svn-pre-commit: should now stop trunk replace.

[#1804](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1804):
rose_ana: extra retry database operations on failure.

[#1802](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/1802):
